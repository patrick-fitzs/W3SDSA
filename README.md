# **W3Schools DSA Course**

This project contains Python implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) inspired by the W3Schools DSA course. The repository is organized into folders, including **Binary Trees**, **Hash Tables**, **Linked Lists**, **Sorting**, and **Stacks and Queues**, each containing scripts for key operations such as traversals, insertions, deletions, and various algorithmic approaches. It's a well recommended course and definitely helps with understanding the crucial elements of DSA.
